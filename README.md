# Image-Color-Quantization
Color quantization or color image quantization is a process that reduces the number of distinct colors used in an image, usually with the intention that the new image should be as visually similar as possible to the original image<br />
We implement this using the Kmeans MiniBatch functions. The image is first converted to L*a*b format because of it gives better perception of colors and their distances in 3-D space. The L*a*b color format is also closer to human perception system
